## ⚡ SYSTEM DIRECTIVE

**TermBackup** is a high-fidelity cryptographic engine designed to fortify your digital assets against infiltration. Operating locally at layer zero, TermBackup dynamically encapsulates your data payloads using AES-256-GCM + Argon2id algorithms, syncing the ciphered vault directly to your private GitHub repos.

> [!CAUTION] 
> **End-to-End Encryption Protocol:** Your raw files are isolated locally. GitHub never processes your unencrypted payloads.

## 🌌 MATRIX UPLINK CAPABILITIES

*   🛡️ **Zero-Trust Paranoia**: Absolute client-side encryption. The cloud nodes hold only algorithmic noise. Without your strict pass-key, the sequence is unbreakable.
*   ⚡ **Quantum Diff Sync**: Intelligent delta-scanning uploads only the mutated sectors of your databanks, preserving time and bandwidth.
*   🛸 **Holographic CLI**: Immerse yourself in a real-time terminal UI complete with spinning diagnostics, cyber-panels, and gradient tracking grids.
*   🕒 **Chronos Restore**: Peer into previous epochs. Reconstruct your archives exactly as they were in any temporal snapshot.
*   👻 **Ghost Protocol (Daemon)**: Initialize `termbackup daemon` to deploy a silent background watcher, backing up critical files seamlessly at scheduled intervals.
*   🧩 **Extension Subsystem**: Extend functionality with pre-compiled modules like Holographic Scanners, Telemetry grids, and Auto-Shredders.

## 🧑‍🚀 INSTALLATION PROTOCOL

TermBackup operates independently outside of legacy registries like PyPI. Direct synchronization from the core GitHub repository ensures the highest unadulterated fidelity.

> [!TIP]
> The recommended installation path utilizes `pipx` to isolate the environment variables.

### Primary Command Line
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/scorpiocodex/Termbackup.git
```

### Alternative Python Protocol
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/scorpiocodex/Termbackup.git
```

## 🚀 BOOT SEQUENCE QUICK-START

Arming the system takes seconds. Follow the sequence:

**1. Establish Local Linkage**
Connect TermBackup securely to your core GitHub network using your Personal Access Token.
```bash
termbackup init
```

**2. Configure Payload Profile**
Designate a folder structure to encrypt and sync to a secure void repo.
```bash
termbackup profile create <mission-name> --source /path/to/my-files --repo scorpiocodex/target-repo
```

**3. Engage TermBackup Core**
Ignite the engine. Input your master cryptographic key.
```bash
termbackup run <mission-name>
```

## 🔌 THE PLUG-IN METAVERSE

The TermBackup core comes pre-fitted with **7 powerful modules** to intercept and augment local procedures.

Verify active plugins with: `termbackup plugins list`

### Notable Nexus Extensions:
*   📊 **`termbackup_plugin_telemetry`**: Overlays real-time system performance (CPU load, RAM pressure) into the deployment UI holographically.
*   🔮 **`termbackup_plugin_hologram`**: Engages a stunning pre-backup matrix-data sweep visualization.
*   🗑️ **`termbackup_plugin_shred`**: A covert module that securely overwrites and destroys temporary cache sectors with random bit-noise after synchronization.
*   🛡️ **`termbackup_plugin_strict_audit`**: Engages multi-pass cryptographic validation sub-routines.
*   🖥️ **`termbackup_plugin_tui`**: Mounts an interactive visual text UI dashboard. (`termbackup plugins tui`)

> [!NOTE]
> Additional community-developed extensions prefixed with `termbackup-plugin-` can be seamlessly loaded dynamically from any Python environment!
