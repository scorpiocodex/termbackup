## [6.0.0] "NEXUS ZERO-TRUST" - 2026-02-22

### 🚀 Major Uplink Mutations
- **Complete Holographic Redesign**: Global rewrite of the terminal interface (`typer` + `rich`) implementing deep cyber-gradients, matrix-green validation icons, and structured control panels.
- **Extension Metaverse Overhaul**: Added powerful zero-configuration plugin modules bundled into the core framework:
  - `telemetry`: Injects real-time local CPU and RAM pressure metrics holographically prior to execution.
  - `hologram`: Initializes a matrix-sweep visualization effect for intense aesthetic feedback during payload preparation.
  - `shredder`: Enhances operational security by dynamically overwriting leftover temp-files with localized random bit-noise before secure deletion.
- **Git History Anonymization Readiness**: The repository logic has been restructured, purging unverified signatures and ensuring exclusive cryptographic attribution to `ScorpioCodeX`.
- **Decoupled PyPI Distribution**: Official installation vectors strictly funnel through primary GitHub URLs via `pipx` for maximum supply chain security and reduced footprint.

### 🛡️ Core Hardening
- Complete scrubbing of generic `TODO` hooks, replacing static fallbacks with active validation loops and error tracking.
- Resolved fatal Daemon exit signal ignoring — unrecoverable signals (`SIGINT/SIGTERM`) are caught, printed as diagnostics, and immediately rupture the ghost loop for rapid process termination.
- Zero-Trust routines strictly prohibit tracking of configuration signatures off-local.

### ✨ Visual & UX Adjustments
- Reconstructed the `termbackup --help` protocol to render as a compartmentalized, categorized, cyberpunk control panel.
- Refitted the `README.md` into an aesthetically superior presentation matrix, prioritizing simplicity without sacrificing operational directives.
